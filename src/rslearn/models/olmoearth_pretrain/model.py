        Args:
            patch_size: token spatial patch size to use.
            model_id: the model ID to load. One of model_id or model_path or checkpoint_path must be
                set.
            model_path: the path to load the model from. One of model_id or model_path or checkpoint_path must be
                set. Same structure as the HF-hosted `model_id` models: bundle with a config.json and weights.pth.
            checkpoint_path: the checkpoint directory to load from, if model_id or model_path is not
                set. It should contain a distributed checkpoint with a config.json file as well as model_and_optim
                folder.
            selector: an optional sequence of attribute names or list indices to select
                the sub-module that should be applied on the input images. Defaults to
                ["encoder"] to select only the transformer encoder.
            forward_kwargs: additional arguments to pass to forward pass besides the
                 MaskedOlmoEarthSample.
            random_initialization: whether to skip loading the checkpoint so the
                weights are randomly initialized. In this case, the checkpoint is only
                used to define the model architecture.
            embedding_size: optional embedding size to report via
                get_backbone_channels (if model_id is not set).
            autocast_dtype: which dtype to use for autocasting, or set None to disable.
            token_pooling: whether or not to pool the tokens. If True, the output will be BxCxHxW. If False,
                there will be an extra dimension, N, (BxCxHxWxN) representing the temporal and channel
                dimensions.
            use_legacy_timestamps: set timestamps to dummy values [1 January 2024, 1 February 2024, ...]
                instead of the actual timestamps of the input. The option to do this is preserved
                for backwards compatability with finetuned models which were trained against this
                original implementation. If set False, then we determine the timesteps across modalities
                based on the actual image timestamps with a greedy algorithm.
            timestamp_error_tolerance: when use_legacy_timestamps=False, if there are multiple modalities,
                we try to align timesteps across modalities. To do so, we use a greedy algorithm, where
                if the closest previous timestamp to a new image is within timestamp_error_tolerance of
                the new image's capture time, then we reuse that timestamp; otherwise, we create a new
                timestep.
